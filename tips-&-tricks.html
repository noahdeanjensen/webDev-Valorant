            <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
            <p id="page-intro">Playing Valorant for the first time can be frustrating when you feel like you don't know
                what
                you are doing!
                Here are some tips & tricks that you should know in order to play better.</p>
            <div class="tip">

                <h3>Master a few agents</h3>
                <p>As of today, there are 23 agents in Valorant for you to choose from. If you are always changing who
                    you
                    are playing as, then you will never feel comfortable playing these characters. It is especially
                    important in the beginning to find one or two characters that you like and really learn how their
                    abilities work. This will make you more confident with their moves which will allow you to focus on
                    strategy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Crosshair placement is everything</h3>
                <p>An aspect in the game that is important to master early on is crosshair placement. All of the
                    characters
                    are
                    the same height meaning that if you keep your crosshair at head level at all times, then you won't
                    have
                    to
                    aim and can simply shoot when you see them. Mastering crosshair placement will allow you to turn
                    corners
                    and
                    already be aiming for their heads in order to get easy kills.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Communication is key</h3>
                <p>Commnicating with your teammates is very important in Valorant. Valorant is a team game and
                    communicating
                    with your teammates will allow you to strategize and be aware of what you can do to better work as a
                    team.
                    It's always a good idea to explain what you plan to do during the round so that others can play with
                    you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Find the right sensitivity for you</h3>
                <p>A lot of players don't have the right mouse sensitivity when they start playing Valorant. Having a
                    sens
                    that
                    is too high will not allow you to make the micro-adjustments that are required when the enemy peaks
                    corners.
                    Having a sens that is too low will leave you reacting slower and you will have to move your mouse
                    way
                    too
                    much. I would recommend going into the firing range to practice shooting bots in order to find a
                    sens
                    that
                    works for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Your team composition does matter</h3>
                <p>Valorant has 4 different roles that agents fall under: duelist, sentinel, initiator, controller. It
                    is
                    important to make sure that your team comp includes all of these roles in some way. The basic team
                    composition that is good is 1 controller to smoke off the map, 1 sentinel to watch the flank, 1
                    initiator to
                    scout the bomb-site, and two duelists to take space and get kills. Team compositions can vary, but
                    you
                    will
                    definately want at least 1 controller and initiator.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Be smart with you economy</h3>
                <p>It is important to pay attention to your economy in the game. If your teammates are saving, then you
                    should
                    save with them. If they are buying, then you should try to buy with them. Something else to consider
                    is
                    if
                    you lose pistol round, then you should save the next round unless you are positive that you will win
                    if
                    your
                    force buy. Having a good economy can easly be
                    the difference between winning or losing a game.</p>
