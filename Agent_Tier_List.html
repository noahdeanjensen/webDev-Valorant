        <div id="Classes">
            <h2>Classes</h2>

            <h4>Duelist</h4>
            <p>Duelists are “self-sufficient fraggers,” according to Riot’s official description. They’re the agents that create some of the most impact, offering aggression to a team comp. A duelist should be expected to seek out engagements and frag, may that be finding the opening pick or clutching out a round. </p>

            <h4>Controllers</h4>
            <p>Controllers are experts in “slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success.” This usually comes in the form of smokes, which can be used to offensively or defensively block off a target’s vision but also slows, stuns, and in some cases, flashes.</p>

            <h4>Initiators</h4>
            <p>Initiators “challenge angles by setting up their team to enter contested ground and push defenders away.” These agents often excel on the offensive, setting up their teammates for success. Breach, Gekko, KAY/O, and Skye offer flashes or stuns in one form or another, while Sova provides vision.</p>

            <h4>Sentinels</h4>
            <p>Sentinels are “defensive experts who can lock down areas and watch flanks, both on attack and defender rounds.” In a game dedicated to planting or defusing the Spike, these agents are crucial. Chamber, Cypher, Deadlock, and Killjoy hold down sites with their gizmos and gadgets, while Sage puts a stop to pushes and rotations with slows and barricades.</p>

                        Japanese native Yoru rips holes straight through reality to infiltrate enemy lines unseen. Using deception and aggression in equal measure, he gets the drop on each target before they know where to look.

                        Filipino Agent, Neon, surges forward at shocking speeds, discharging bursts of bioelectric radiance as fast as her body generates it. She races ahead to catch enemies off guard, then strikes them down quicker than lightning
